# ALX Project Nexus

Welcome to **alx-project-nexus**, a GitHub repository that compiles all of my key learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering** program.

## About the Program

The **ProDev Backend Engineering** program enabled me to develop a strong foundation in building and managing web applications on the server side. I learned how to design APIs that are efficient, secure, maintainable, and scalable using industry-standard tools and best practices.

---

## Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** – Primary programming language
- **Django** – Python web framework for building robust applications
- **REST APIs** – Interface for data exchange between systems
- **GraphQL** – A flexible alternative to REST for API communication
- **Docker** – Containerization tool for managing development environments
- **CI/CD** – Continuous Integration and Deployment automation (e.g., GitHub Actions)

---

## Major Concepts

- **Relational Database Design** (modeling, normalization)
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Optimizing performance
- **Caching Strategies** – Improving API response times

---

## Challenges Faced

- API security issues → Solved using authentication tokens and permission handling
- Docker configuration difficulties → Addressed by improving understanding of Dockerfiles and docker-compose
- CI/CD not triggering correctly → Fixed by correcting the GitHub Actions YAML configuration

---

## Best Practices Adopted

- Clear and up-to-date documentation (README, code comments)
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase)
- Clean error handling (try/except blocks, logging)
- Unit testing for code reliability

---

## Collaboration

This project also serves as an opportunity to collaborate with other learners in the program:

- **Backend learners**: Exchange ideas and provide technical support
- **Frontend learners**: Integrate their frontend with our backend API

**Collaboration space**: Discord channel `#ProDevProjectNexus`
