## üé§ **Speaking Notes Template**

### **Slide 1 (30s):**
*"Good morning. I'm [Your Name], and I'm presenting my ALX capstone project - a modern social media backend API. This project demonstrates enterprise-level architecture using Django, GraphQL, and advanced asynchronous processing."*

### **Slide 2 (45s):**
*"The architecture follows industry best practices with GraphQL providing 38 API endpoints, PostgreSQL for reliable data storage, and Celery managing 9 background tasks. Everything runs in Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments."*

### **Slide 3 (90s):**
*"Let me demonstrate the core functionality. [Switch to live demo] Here's the GraphQL playground where developers can interact with the API. The admin dashboard provides complete content management, and our comprehensive documentation makes integration straightforward for frontend teams."*

### **Slide 4 (60s):**
*"Technical excellence was prioritized throughout development. JWT authentication ensures security, comprehensive error handling provides reliability, and asynchronous task processing enables scalability. The system maintains sub-second response times while supporting concurrent users."*

### **Slide 5 (45s):**
*"This project exceeds all ALX requirements with bonus features including real-time notifications, advanced content moderation, and production-ready monitoring. The modern GraphQL approach and enterprise-grade architecture demonstrate readiness for professional development environments."*
